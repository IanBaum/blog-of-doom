    "content": "I never believed I would be a man who could or would publicly claim that demons were responsible for the most tragic moments of my life.  I always thought that such people were out of their minds--just totally floored by neurosis; swept away by its genetic predisposition and befallen by the logical pitfalls and ills of living around other humans who were all smitten by and plagued with the wounded human condition.
    Until last week happened.  It was during the highest peak of fall, and I felt its presence all around my living room.  Yes, I heard its resounding voice boom as it told me what it had done to me before I was even born; what it had done to so many other beings from the beginning of recorded history.  My unripe avocado fell to the floor.  No avocados ripened anymore, no matter how long ago it had been picked off of the shelves of the produce aisle.  I felt depleted, and wept as I bit into the green stagnant fruit.",
